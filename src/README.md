# Coding rules (to be completed)

- Follow tslint rules using the provided ../lint/tslint.json configuration file.

## fields

- public field : don't create a getter and a setter

```
public name type;
```

- read-only field :

```
public readonly name: type;
```

- private field :

```
private name: type;
```

- volatile fields (should not be serialized by the persister) : begin the name with two underscores

```
public __name1 type;
private __name2: type;
```

## comments

- prefix fields and methods declarations with natural doc comments using javadov delimiter /\*\* (it's visual studio code friendly)

## enums

- name should end with Enum
- use const enums wherever possible
- always start at value 1 to enable safe truthy checks

```
const enum MyEnum {
    VALUE1 = 1,
    VALUE2,
    VALUE3
}
```

## array iteration

- if you know you're dealing with a real array and it's not undefined, use for..of

```
for (let item of myArray) { ... }
```

- else use the classic loop

```
for (let i:number = 0, len: number = myArray ? myArray.length : 0; i < len; ++i) { ... }
```

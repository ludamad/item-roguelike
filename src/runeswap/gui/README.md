# lightweight widget toolkit
This directory contains the source code of a lightweight widget toolkit.

Right now, the toolkit is pretty empty as it contains only what is needed by GeneRogue. More widgets will be supported as the game UI gets more complex.

# WIDGETS
    - Label
    - Button
    - VPanel / HPanel
    - Slider
    - Draggable / DragTarget
    - Frame

# TODO

Reminder for stuff that might be added to the toolkit. Or not.

* Core
    - modal widgets should reset Umbra input automagically
    - handle generic key bindings (Configuration.input)
* Widgets
    - textBox
